## Task: Metro Ticket Purchasing System

Your task is to write a command-line app that allows users to purchase tickets to travel from one metro station to another. Youâ€™re required to use the concepts of Object Oriented Programming to achieve this.

## Functionality

1. Users can see a list of all the metro stations available.
2. Users can purchase a ticket from one metro station to another.
3. Users can see their purchased tickets.
4. Each ticket has a unique ID associated with it.
5. The price of a ticket is based on how many stations the user will cross on the shortest path to their destination.
6. There can be multiple metro lines, and some stations are expected to act as crossroads between 2 or more lines, which allows passengers to change lines.
7. Users can purchase tickets to travel between stations on different lines.
8. You must provide a list of instructions to assist the user in case there is a line change between the origin and the destination.
9. Make multiple CSV files to store data for each different class. You can populate the actual objects in these files at the start of the program or as and when it is required.
